# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis-Telecom-Domain-
Telco Customer Churn Analysis using Python &amp; Data Visualization â€“ Performed EDA on 7,043 records using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib). Found 26.5% churn, higher among senior citizens (42%), month-to-month contracts (43%), and Electronic Check users (45%), providing retention insights.
# ðŸ“Š Telco Customer Churn Analysis (Python EDA & Visualization)

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to identify factors influencing customer attrition in the telecom industry.  
Using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover churn patterns and provide actionable insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: kaggle
- Size: 7,043 customer records
- Features: Demographics, Contract details, Internet & Phone services, Payment methods, Churn status

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.5% of customers churned
- **Demographics:**
  - Senior citizens: 42% churn vs. 24% for non-seniors
  - Gender: Minimal impact (~26% churn for both)
- **Tenure:**
  - Customers <6 months: >50% churn
  - Customers >2 years: <15% churn
- **Contract Type:**
  - Month-to-month: 43% churn
  - One-year: 11% churn
  - Two-year: 3% churn
- **Service Features:**
  - Without Online Security â†’ 42% churn
  - Without Tech Support â†’ 40% churn
- **Payment Method:**
  - Electronic Check â†’ 45% churn
  - Other payment modes â†’ <20% churn

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
The project includes multiple visualizations:
- Churn distribution (Countplot, Pie chart)
- Churn by Gender & Senior Citizen
- Tenure distribution by churn status
- Churn by Contract type
- Churn by Service features & Payment methods

---

## âœ… Conclusion
Customer churn is heavily influenced by:
- Short tenure and flexible (month-to-month) contracts
- Lack of value-added services (Online Security, Tech Support)
- Payment method (Electronic Check users churn more)

**Retention Strategies:**
- Encourage **long-term contracts**
- Provide **service bundles**
- Promote **secure payment options**
